             <ul style="color: #133db3;"> 
                <li> this story takes place in a fictional world in which humans and magical creatures coexist. </li>
        <li> these magical creatures are called ethereals. </li>
            <li> they draw their power from the multiple moons that revolve around their planet. ethereal culture, hierarchy and religion revolve around these moons. </li>
        <li> ethereals can cast spells and shapeshift </li>
        <li> the more powerful someone's magic is, the higher they rank in society. their supreme ruler has the highest magical ability out of anyone in their world. </li>
        <li> humans are seen as inferior due to their lack of magical ability and are ruled over by ethereals</li>
        <li> humans study potion making, but are incapable of casting spells</li> </ul>
        <p style="color: #3e66d3;"> the ruler essentially dedicates their entire existence to the moons and their subjects. their whole life is spent studying and honing their magic. <br>
        the ruler is expected to perform many rituals in which they harness the moon's power to strengthen the kingdom and the magic of all ethereals.
    these rituals are highly celebrated and seen as a great honor, however, to the ruler they may feel more like a great sacrifice.
over the course of many years and rituals, the all-powerful ruler begins to wither away.
overexertion of their magic inevitably stretches them thin, and they die a very slow and painful death
as their body rots. <br> 
at this point, the ruler passes their thrown on to their child. 
the child inherets the most innately powerful magic in the kingdom, as well as the cruel fate of a life
that will never truly belong to them.

<center> <img src="luciano (2) (1).png" width="300"> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> 
    next in line to inherit the throne, luciano lives under the crushing pressure of the expectations placed on him.
    he is a highly dedicated and skilled person, having given himself fully to his studies and training.
    as his mother withers away, his magic has become the strongest on their planet, meaning
    that the time to crown him approaches rapidly. <br>
    his society insists that he view others as inferiors, and has slowly but surely beat the belief into him. <br>
    but for a long time, he refused to believe it. it didn't feel true to him at all. after all, the one person
    that he felt comfortable around, his respit from the constant, intense pressure, was the antitheses of
    orderly, refined magic.
