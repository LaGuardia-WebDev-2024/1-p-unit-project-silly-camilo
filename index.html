             <ul style="color: #133db3;"> 
                <li> this story takes place in a fictional world in which humans and magical creatures coexist. </li>
        <li> these magical creatures are called ethereals. </li>
            <li> they draw their power from the multiple moons that revolve around their planet. ethereal culture, hierarchy and religion revolve around these moons. </li>
        <li> ethereals can cast spells and shapeshift </li>
        <li> the more powerful someone's magic is, the higher they rank in society. their supreme ruler has the highest magical ability out of anyone in their world. </li>
        <li> humans are seen as inferior due to their lack of magical ability and are ruled over by ethereals</li>
        <li> humans study potion making, but are incapable of casting spells</li> </ul>
        <p style="color: #3e66d3;"> the ruler essentially dedicates their entire existence to the moons and their subjects. their whole life is spent studying and honing their magic. <br>
        the ruler is expected to perform many rituals in which they harness the moon's power to strengthen the kingdom and the magic of all ethereals.
    these rituals are highly celebrated and seen as a great honor, however, to the ruler they may feel more like a great sacrifice.
over the course of many years and rituals, the all-powerful ruler begins to wither away.
overexertion of their magic inevitably stretches them thin, and they die a very slow and painful death
as their body rots. <br> 
at this point, the ruler passes their thrown on to their child. 
the child inherets the most innately powerful magic in the kingdom, as well as the cruel fate of a life
that will never truly belong to them.

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">QUEEN AMAYA CELESTE</h2>
<center> <img src="img/meoww_20250920004407 (1).png" width="600" alt="amaya adorned in jewels. she has dark skin, pointy ears, and periwinkle eyes and hair." </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> as the current ruler of their world, amaya has completed many sacrifices and ceremonies to strengthen her people at her own expense.
she was once incredibly strong, and though she is still an imposing figure, she has become frail. her extremities have been taken over by inky scratches, proof that her body is collapsing on itself, eating itself alive.
she has dedicated her life to her magic, and takes her responsibility as ruler incredibly seriously. <br>
all her life she had been excited to become ruler, to serve her kingdom, and so she feels a desperate confusion about the fact that everything she is expected to do just
hurts her. she lives in constant pain from the sacrifices, and angrily tries to convince herself that everything makes sense
even as she suffers ceaselessly. <br>
her son, luciano, is her pride and joy. she expects and demands the same perfection from him as she does from herself.
however, rather inevitably, with no support system, she passes on and even takes out her suffering onto him.</p>

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(246, 249, 255);">LUCIANO CELESTE / luné</h2>
<center> <img src="img/luciano (2) (1).png" width="600" alt="humanoid ethereal with pointy ears, long light blue locs and a serious expression."> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> 
    next in line to inherit the throne, luciano lives under the crushing pressure of the expectations placed on him.
    he is a highly dedicated and skilled person, having given himself fully to his studies and training.
    as his mother withers away, his magic has become the strongest on their planet, meaning
    that the time to crown him approaches rapidly. <br>
    his society insists that he view others as inferiors, and has slowly but surely beat the belief into him. <br>
    but for a long time, he refused to believe it. after all, the one person
    that he felt comfortable around, his respit from the constant, intense pressure, was the antitheses of
    orderly, refined magic.
     </p>


     <h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">CIELO MONTE</h2>
<center> <img src="img/CIELITOO (2).png" width="600" alt="an ethereal with patches of fur all over him, with pastel yellow and pink hair. there are 3 sets of fluffy ears on his head!"> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;">
    cielo has always been ostracized for how peculiarly his magic behaves. he's very powerful, but in such a raw and unusual way
that his magic is much harder for him to control than it is for others. 
for instance, his signature appearance. his human form is covered in gems and fur, and his fangs and claws are far longer than they should be.
this is apalling to the ethereal culture and society, in which order is such an important value. he is constantly shunned and rejected.
when he was younger, he would even be attacked. he experienced horrendous bullying from the other young
ethereals that saw him as a disgusting abnormality, and therefore a threat. his refuge was the prince who shielded him from
their violence. </p>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> in contrast to luné (his nickname for prince luciano) he has a wonderful, warm relationship with his mother. he admires her,
    and does not fear her, something luné struggles to imagine. in fact, cielos mother (eliana) was the one person who constantly instilled confidence and strength in him, even as the world tried constantly to tear him down.

<center> <img src="img/SILLY BABIES (1).png" width="80%" alt="a group of four human friends, represented by the colors teal, orange, pink and purple."> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;">
    cielo and luné end up unofficially adopting a group of children that tag along to their journey. cielo takes to them immediately,
finding them charming and wondrous. luné, on the other hand, comes around very slowly. at first, he sees them
as an utter nuisance. however, through enough time together (and that means <em>years</em>), he begins
to grow fond of them and all their
human peculiarities. he even subconsciously feels that he can relate to them in many aspects, and without
realizing, many of his actions become driven by the need to protect and
care for them.  <br>

        <li style="color: rgb(83, 212, 219);">
           <em> <strong> river</strong></em> is a shy, sweet and caring friend. he is in training to be a healer 
           and is constantly practicing his potions, wholeheartedly aiming to heal and help others. he is highly 
           sensitive and self critical as well as highly empathetic. essentially, he has abundant understanding 
           and patience for everyone but himself, in whom he can only see faults. by huge contrast, he sees others, 
           especially his friends, with passionate, warm admiration. <br> river finds that his only sense of purpose 
           is taking care of others. it is the only way that he feels he can make up for his existence and have a 
           positive effect on the world.

          <li style="color: rgb(255, 198, 154);">
            what <em> <strong> verano </strong></em> lacks in brain capacity, he makes up for in kindness.
            he constantly relieves tension and keeps spirits up with his sense of humor. he may not be
            the brightest or most graceful, but he is a fiercely loyal friend that will always
            stand up for others. he is highly extroverted and outgoing, a lover of adventure who always
            wants to tag along. he is also rather impulsive and often acts without
            weighing the possibilities or even remembering the existence of consequences... but its fine.
            his happy-go-lucky, can-do attitude has earned on his friends behalf, much love, appreciation (and all manner of protection
            from his own impulsive tendencies).

          <li style="color: rgb(255, 186, 215);">
            <em> <strong> cherry </strong></em> is unapologetically herself, and firmly believes that everyone else
            should be too! her utter lack of magical ability (including the potion mixing that humans
            can usually practice), has many times made her the target of harsh judgement and maltreatment, especially
             by superiors. 
            nevertheless, she has come to understand that there is nothing wrong with her,
            and her favorite way to fight back is to simply be unabashedly and joyously herself anyway.
            thereby, though she brings about disgust in the followers
            of the hierarchy, she is also constantly
             inspiring joy, confidence and hope in those around her too.
            she always sees the best in people and believes that the world is an ultimately beautiful place,
            and that everyone has magic inside of them. <br>
            shes picked up many crafty hobbies as she loves exploring and practicing new skills.
            chief among them, she is a talented seamstress and loves making and patching up clothes for herself
            and her friends. she is always wearing something handcrafted and loves
            expressing herself in her colorful clothing.

          <li style="color: rgb(202, 175, 255);">
            <em> <strong> reina </strong></em> is a softy with a witty, spiky exterior. she’s constantly trying to 
            prove herself, though she would never admit it. an outsider may see her as rude and disruptive, but her 
            friends would tell you that she’s just blunt, funny, intelligent, and quietly but deeply considerate (especially 
            towards them). however, tormented by feelings of inferiority, she externalizes them constantly to protect 
            herself, and as a result is a rather defensive and abrasive person. she is short-fused, intolerant 
            of any disrespect, and has a tendency to view minor issues blown way out of proportion. little things going
            wrong are likely to sour her whole day, even as she would swear up and down that she doesnt even care. 
            it all really just points to an inner sadness and insecurity that she does everything to avoid
            facing, and that slowly but surely, her friends help soothe and melt away.
