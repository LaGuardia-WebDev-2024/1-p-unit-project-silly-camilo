                <li> this story takes place in a fictional world in which humans and magical creatures coexist. </li>
        <li> these magical creatures are called ethereals. </li>
            <li> they draw their power from the multiple moons that revolve around their planet. ethereal culture, hierarchy and religion revolve around these moons. </li>
        <li> ethereals can cast spells and shapeshift </li>
        <li> the more powerful someone's magic is, the higher they rank in society. their supreme ruler has the highest magical ability out of anyone in their world. </li>
        <li> humans are seen as inferior due to their lack of magical ability and are ruled over by ethereals</li>
        <li> humans study potion making, but are incapable of casting spells</li>
        <p style="color: #133db3;"> the ruler essentially dedicates their entire existence to the moons and their subjects. their whole life is spent studying and honing their magic. <br>
        the ruler is expected to perform many rituals in which they harness the moon's power to strengthen the kingdom and the magic of all ethereals.
    these rituals are highly celebrated and seen as a great honor, however, to the ruler they may feel more like a great sacrifice.
over the course of many years and rituals, the all-powerful ruler begins to wither away.
overexertion of their magic inevitably stretches them thin, and they die a very slow and painful death
as their body rots. <br> 
at this point, the ruler passes their thrown on to their child. 
the child inherets the most innately powerful magic in the kingdom, as well as the cruel fate of a life
that will never truly belong to them.
