             <ul style="color: #133db3;"> 
                <li> this story takes place in a fictional world in which humans and magical creatures coexist. </li>
        <li> these magical creatures are called ethereals. </li>
            <li> they draw their power from the multiple moons that revolve around their planet. ethereal culture, hierarchy and religion revolve around these moons. </li>
        <li> ethereals can cast spells and shapeshift </li>
        <li> the more powerful someone's magic is, the higher they rank in society. their supreme ruler has the highest magical ability out of anyone in their world. </li>
        <li> humans are seen as inferior due to their lack of magical ability and are ruled over by ethereals</li>
        <li> humans study potion making, but are incapable of casting spells</li> </ul>
        <p style="color: #3e66d3;"> the ruler essentially dedicates their entire existence to the moons and their subjects. their whole life is spent studying and honing their magic. <br>
        the ruler is expected to perform many rituals in which they harness the moon's power to strengthen the kingdom and the magic of all ethereals.
    these rituals are highly celebrated and seen as a great honor, however, to the ruler they may feel more like a great sacrifice.
over the course of many years and rituals, the all-powerful ruler begins to wither away.
overexertion of their magic inevitably stretches them thin, and they die a very slow and painful death
as their body rots. <br> 
at this point, the ruler passes their thrown on to their child. 
the child inherets the most innately powerful magic in the kingdom, as well as the cruel fate of a life
that will never truly belong to them.

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">QUEEN AMAYA CELESTE</h2>
<center> <img src=> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> as the current ruler of their world, amaya has completed many sacrifices and ceremonies to strengthen her people at her own expense.
she was once incredibly strong, and though she is still an imposing figure, she has become frail. her extremities have been taken over by inky scratches, proof that her body is collapsing on itself, eating itself alive.
she has dedicated her life to her magic, and takes her responsibility as ruler incredibly seriously. <br>
all her life she had been excited to become ruler, to serve her kingdom, and so she feels a desperate confusion about the fact that everything she is expected to do just
hurts her. she lives in constant pain from the sacrifices, and angrily tries to convince herself that everything makes sense
even as she suffers ceaselessly. <br>
her son, luciano, is her pride and joy. she expects and demands the same perfection from him as she does from herself.
however, rather inevitably, with no support system, she passes on and even takes out her suffering onto him.

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">LUCIANO CELESTE / luné</h2>
<center> <img src="img/luciano (2) (1).png" width="300" alt="humanoid ethereal with pointy ears, long light blue locs and a serious expression."> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> 
    next in line to inherit the throne, luciano lives under the crushing pressure of the expectations placed on him.
    he is a highly dedicated and skilled person, having given himself fully to his studies and training.
    as his mother withers away, his magic has become the strongest on their planet, meaning
    that the time to crown him approaches rapidly. <br>
    his society insists that he view others as inferiors, and has slowly but surely beat the belief into him. <br>
    but for a long time, he refused to believe it. after all, the one person
    that he felt comfortable around, his respit from the constant, intense pressure, was the antitheses of
    orderly, refined magic.
     </p>


     <h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">CIELO MONTE</h2>
<center> <img src="img/CIELITOO (2).png" width="300" alt="an ethereal with patches of fur all over him, with pastel yellow and pink hair. there are 3 sets of fluffy ears on his head!"> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;">
    cielo has always been ostracized for how peculiarly his magic behaves. he's very powerful, but in such a raw and unusual way
that his magic is much harder for him to control than it is for others. 
for instance, his signature appearance. his human form is covered in gems and fur, and his fangs and claws are far longer than they should be.
this is apalling to ethereal society that so values order, and he is constantly shunned and rejected.
when he was younger, he would even be attacked. he experienced horrendous bullying from the other young
ethereals that saw him as a disgusting abnormality, and therefore a threat. his refuge was the prince who shielded him from
their violence. </p>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> in contrast to luné (his nickname for prince luciano) he has a wonderful, warm relationship with his mother. he admires her,
    and does not feain fact, she was the one person who constantly instilled in him confidence and strength, as the world tried to tear him down.
