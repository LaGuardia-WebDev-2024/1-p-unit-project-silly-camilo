                <li> this story takes place in a fictional world in which humans and magical creatures coexist. </li>
        <li> these magical creatures are called ethereals. </li>
            <li> they draw their power from the multiple moons that revolve around their planet. ethereal culture, hierarchy and religion revolve around these moons. </li>
        <li> ethereals can cast spells and shapeshift </li>
        <li> the more powerful someone's magic is, the higher they rank in society. their supreme ruler has the highest magical ability out of anyone in their world. </li>
        <li> humans are seen as inferior due to their lack of magical ability and are ruled over by ethereals</li>
        <li> humans study potion making, but are incapable of casting spells</li>
        <p style="color: #133db3;"> the ruler essentially dedicates their entire existence to the moons and their subjects. </p>
