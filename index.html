                <li> this story takes place in a fictional world in which humans and magical creatures, called ethereals, coexist. </li>
            <li> they draw their power from the multiple moons that revolve around their planet. ethereal culture, hierarchy and religion revolve around these moons. </li>
        <li> ethereals can cast spells and shapeshift </li>
        <li> the more powerful someone's magic is, the higher they rank in society. their supreme ruler has the highest magical ability out of anyone in their world. </li>
        <li> humans are seen as inferior due to their lack of magical ability and are ruled over by ethereals</li>
        <li> humans study potion making, but are incapable of casting spells</li> </ul>
        <p style="color: #3e66d3;"> the ruler essentially dedicates their entire existence to the moons and their subjects. their whole life is spent studying and honing their magic. <br>
        the ruler is expected to perform many rituals in which they harness the moon's power to strengthen the kingdom and the magic of all ethereals.
    these rituals are highly celebrated and seen as a great honor, however, to the ruler they may feel more like a great sacrifice.
over the course of many years and rituals, the all-powerful ruler begins to wither away.
overexertion of their magic inevitably stretches them thin, and they die a very slow and painful death
as their body rots. <br> 
at this point, the ruler passes their thrown on to their child. 
the child inherets the most innately powerful magic in the kingdom, as well as the cruel fate of a life
that will never truly belong to them.

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">QUEEN AMAYA CELESTE</h2>
<center> <img src="img/meoww_20250920004407 (1).png" width="400" alt="amaya adorned in jewels. she has dark skin, pointy ears, and periwinkle eyes and hair."> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> as the current ruler of their world, amaya has completed many sacrifices and ceremonies to strengthen her people at her own expense.
she was once incredibly strong, and though she is still an imposing figure, she has become frail. her extremities have been taken over by inky scratches, proof that her body is collapsing on itself, eating itself alive.
she has dedicated her life to her magic, and takes her responsibility as ruler incredibly seriously. <br>
all her life she had been excited to become ruler, to serve her kingdom, and so she feels a desperate confusion about the fact that everything she is expected to do just
hurts her. she lives in constant pain from the sacrifices, and angrily tries to convince herself that everything makes sense
even as she suffers ceaselessly. <br>
her son, luciano, is her pride and joy. she expects and demands the same perfection from him as she does from herself.
however, rather inevitably, with no support system, she passes on and even takes out her suffering onto him.</p>

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(246, 249, 255);">LUCIANO CELESTE / luné</h2>
<center> <img src="img/luciano (2) (1).png" width="300" alt="humanoid ethereal with pointy ears, long light blue locs and a serious expression."> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> 
    next in line to inherit the throne, luciano lives under the crushing pressure of the expectations placed on him.
    he is a highly dedicated and skilled person, having given himself fully to his studies and training.
    as his mother withers away, his magic has become the strongest on their planet, meaning
    that the time to crown him approaches rapidly. <br>
    despite what his position demands of him, it was never lunés nature to control and
    rule over others. as a child, he was always warm, gentle, and understanding. however, 
    his entire society insisted that he view others as inferiors, and has 
    managed to beat the belief into him by now. he has grown to perfectly embody the ideal 
    ethereal overlord. his dignified presence commands attention, and his every action has been
    orchestrated perfectly. <br>
    but it took many years for him to quit doubting so much and finally get to this point. <br>
    after all, the one person
    that he had felt comfortable around, his respit from the constant, intense pressure, had been the very antitheses of
    orderly, refined magic.
     </p>


     <h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">CIELO MONTE</h2>
<center> <img src="img/CIELITOO (2).png" width="300" alt="an ethereal with patches of fur all over him, with pastel yellow and pink hair. there are 3 sets of fluffy ears on his head!"> </center>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;">
    cielo has always been ostracized for how peculiarly his magic behaves. he's very powerful, but in such a raw and unusual way
that his magic is much harder for him to control than it is for others. 
for instance, his signature appearance. his human form is covered in gems and fur, and his fangs and claws are far longer than they should be.
this is apalling to the ethereal culture and society, in which order is such an important value. he is constantly shunned and rejected.
when he was younger, he would even be attacked. he experienced horrendous bullying from the other young
ethereals that saw him as a disgusting abnormality, and therefore a threat. his refuge was the prince who shielded him from
their violence. </p>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> in contrast to luné (his nickname for prince luciano) he has a wonderful, warm relationship with his mother. he admires her,
    and does not fear her, something luné struggles to imagine. in fact, cielos mother (eliana) was the one person who constantly instilled confidence and strength in him, even as the world tried constantly to tear him down.

<p style="color: #3e66d3;">
    cielo and luné end up unofficially adopting a group of children that tag along to their journey. cielo takes to them immediately,
finding them charming and wondrous. luné, on the other hand, comes around very slowly. at first, he sees them
as an utter nuisance. however, through enough time together (and that means <em>years</em>), he begins
to grow fond of them and all their
human peculiarities. he even subconsciously feels that he can relate to them in many aspects, and without
realizing, many of his actions become driven by the need to protect and
care for them.  <br>

           <em> <strong> river</strong></em> is a shy, sweet and caring friend. he is in training to be a healer 
           and is constantly practicing his potions and remedies, wholeheartedly aiming to heal and help others. he is 
            highly sensitive and self critical as well as highly empathetic. essentially, he has abundant understanding 
           and patience for everyone but himself, in whom he can only see faults. by huge contrast, he sees others, 
           especially his friends, with passionate, warm admiration. <br> river finds that his only sense of purpose 
           is taking care of others. it is the only way that he feels he can make up for his existence and have a 
           positive effect on the world. thus, he is always making little presents, preparing snacks, and patching up 
            literal and metaphorical wounds. despite what he thinks, any one of his friends could tell you that
            he is a wonderful gift of a person to be around, whose very presence feels like a comforting hug.

            what <em> <strong> verano </strong></em> lacks in brain capacity, he makes up for in kindness.
            he constantly relieves tension and keeps spirits up with his sense of humor. he may not be
            the brightest or most graceful, but he is a fiercely loyal friend that will always
            stand up for others. he is highly extroverted and outgoing, a lover of adventure who always
            wants to tag along. he is also rather impulsive and often acts without
            weighing the possibilities or even remembering the existence of consequences... but its fine.
            his happy-go-lucky, can-do attitude has earned on his friends behalf, much love, appreciation (and all manner of protection
            from his own impulsive tendencies).

            <em> <strong> cherry </strong></em> is unapologetically herself, and firmly believes that everyone else
            should be too! her utter lack of magical ability (including the potion mixing that humans
            can usually practice), has many times made her the target of harsh judgement and maltreatment, especially
             by superiors. 
            nevertheless, she has come to understand that there is nothing wrong with her,
            and her favorite way to fight back is to simply be unabashedly and joyously herself anyway.
            thereby, though she brings about disgust in the followers
            of the hierarchy, she is also constantly
             inspiring joy, confidence and hope in those around her too.
            she always sees the best in people and believes that the world is an ultimately beautiful place,
            and that everyone has magic inside of them. <br>
            shes picked up many crafty hobbies as she loves exploring and practicing new skills.
            chief among them, she is a talented seamstress and loves making and patching up clothes for herself
            and her friends. she is always wearing something handcrafted and loves
            expressing herself in her colorful clothing.

            <em> <strong> reina </strong></em> is a softy with a witty, spiky exterior. she’s constantly trying to 
            prove herself, though she would never admit it. an outsider may see her as rude and disruptive, but her 
            friends would tell you that she’s just blunt, funny, intelligent, and quietly but deeply considerate (especially 
            towards them). however, tormented by feelings of inferiority, she externalizes them constantly to protect 
            herself, and as a result is a rather defensive and abrasive person. she is short-fused, intolerant 
            of any disrespect, and has a tendency to view minor issues blown way out of proportion. little things going
            wrong are likely to sour her whole day, even as she would swear up and down that she doesnt even care. 
            it all really just points to an inner sadness and insecurity that she does everything to avoid
            facing, and that slowly but surely, her friends help soothe and melt away.

<h2 style="color: #658eff; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> PLOT & ARCS </h2>
<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> cielo and luné were once the best of friends. in fact, they were really each other’s only friends given their circumstances. in the prince’s case, everyone was intimidated by him and treated him with detached, cordial reverence. in cielo’s case, everyone mistreated him for his peculiar magic. they were both deeply lonely for somewhat opposite reasons, and nonetheless they managed to be each other’s support. for ten years, throughout their childhood and into their teens, their bond strengthened into a meaningful connection. <br>
however, they were growing too close for the queen’s tastes. amaya was disgusted to find that her child was so closely linked to the most abnormal ethereal of his generation, who was rumored to even associate himself with <em> humans </em>. even mentioning these two radical opposites in the same <em> breath </em> was an insult to the order that she had made so many sacrifices to keep. furthermore, she was certain that the misshapen one would ideologically poison her precious child, eventually tearing her one source of happiness away from her. <br>
her last straw was luné sneaking out for the very first time. accompanied by cielo, he dared to attend one of the ceremonial festivals that he had always been barred from. it was seen as beneath the ruler to partake in such festivities, and instead he was expected to merely study them from afar. however, amayas tight hold on him had only caused him to grow increasingly anxious and desperate to break away. deep into the night of the festival, he and cielo used their shapeshifting to escape together. <br>
that night, luné finally understood the warmth and wonder of magic that cielo had always represented. in the palace, magic had always seemed so frigid, calculated, and strenuous. but out here, in the colorful atmosphere, it all suddenly made sense. magic was meant to be freedom, not the chains; love, instead of control. the ceremonial dance took his breath away, encapsulating his realizations. in the elated trek back to the palace, he and cielo resolved to someday dance together at this ceremony, too.<br>
however, when he slipped back into his room, his mother was there waiting for him. in a fit of rage, she threw him to the ground, screaming and hitting him. she left her child a sobbing mess on the floor. luné, indescribably lost, essentially had a dissociative panic attack on his floor until the sky was bright. from then on, he avoided cielo more and more, desperately ignoring how it ached to do so. finally, one day, cielo grabbed him by the shoulder and managed to ask what was wrong and why they hadnt talked properly since the festival. <br>
at that moment, all the pressure mounting on luné burst him open. he begged cielo to leave him alone, breaking into tears. he blamed him for ruining and complicating everything, for poisoning his life. he screamed that he wished they’d never met, and that way everything would’ve been perfect. needless to say cielo was hurt and confused. they fought briefly as cielo pushed back, but it only resulted in the rift between them growing wider. finally, the two were torn apart, just as amaya had wanted. <br>
luné went on to be a perfect prince, albeit constantly suppressing his loneliness and even depression. he completely lost contact with his true emotions and always felt empty, even as he presented himself so perfectly. he tried to accept the fact that he was not a person, he was a symbol, and that he had to play his one role in this world and nothing more. as for cielo, he was bitter for a few years, but sought new refuge in human communities. luné turning on him inspired him to start a rebellion against the corrupt ethereal hierarchy, and he recruited a passionate community of human members (cherry included)! he developed far more normally than luné, though he too refused to acknowledge the little seeds of pain and self hatred that had sprouted deep roots inside him. <br> </p>

<p style="color: #3e66d3;"> thats just background stuff. the story is really incited by the sudden disappearance of queen amaya. desperate to bring her back (and horrified at the idea of being crowned ruler), luciano reaches out to cielo for the first time in years. he reasons with himself that its a smart idea to have him on his side. the plan is to carefully track her down, secretly go out to find her, and restore her place on the throne. cielo agrees to joining him with the secret hope that this could help his rebellion gain more footing. thus, just as they had on the night of the festival so many years ago, they vanished secretly into the night together. <br>
safe to say they got on each others nerves consistently. they had grown into wildly different people, not to mention the unresolved bad blood between them providing many opportunities for arguments. cielo made it his personal mission to annoy luné as much as possible, and luné, angrily hanging on to his pride, did not hold back from insulting him in return. they successfully remained hidden in unexplored forests and caves for a few months, despite their constant bickering and obscure environments providing many obstacles. eventually, however, they ran into three funny little human children: river, verano, and reina, who were runaways from a corrupt magic school. they had no choice but to “keep them” for risk of them spreading their secret otherwise. <br> 
thats how this little group ends up going on this sprawling adventure together. they spend years following clues, honing their skills, and becoming their own sort of family. eventually, they do find amaya… BUT GIRL THATS WAY TOO MUCH TO WRITE DOWN OMG. and this is supposed to be like the synopsis that doesnt spoil everything i guess???? but i yapped so much already!!?!??!!? anyway when they find her its supposed to be suuuper impactful just pretend ur crying pleaaase waaaaaa 😭💔</p>

<p style="color: #3e66d3;"><em><strong> this story is really about generational trauma and the transformative power of love!! </em></strong><br>
throughout the story, by growing to understand and celebrate each other, our protagonists learn to undo the harmful lessons they had been taught about themselves and those around them. for instance, cielo and lucianos insults slowly developed into nothing more than banter. eventually, tentatively, they even found themselves reconstructing and approximating their childhood closeness. lunés relationship with the humans was somewhat similar. through slowly becoming kinder towards them, he grew back in touch with his empathetic nature and his true desire to love and care for others. <br> 
by the end of the story, after many years, luné is a completely transformed person. he is kind and gentle once more, and has finally found happiness after everything. he doesnt feel so afraid, constricted and weighed down anymore. after all, magic is supposed to be love instead of control. <br>
liberated, he and cielo would finally dance together at the ceremony. <br>
some variation of this is the case for pretty much every character! river practices not being so harsh on himself, reina begins to let down her walls, and even amaya begins to see the error of her ways (after extensive, patient dialogue with her son). </p>
